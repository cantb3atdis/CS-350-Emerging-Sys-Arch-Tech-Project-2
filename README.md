# Project 2: Morse Code LED Message via State Machine

## Overview
In this project, we used TI Code Composer Studio (CCS) to program the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL board to send a Morse code message using LEDs and a synchronous state machine. The primary goal was to blink the green, yellow, and red LEDs in the lower right corner of the board to convey a message in Morse code. Additionally, we implemented functionality to change the Morse code message when a button is pressed.

## Milestone Objectives
1. **Development of Code**: We developed code to achieve the desired functionality, including the state machine's operation and handling button presses.
2. **Timer Initialization**: We initialized the timer and used it to control the state machine's timing.
3. **Interrupt Handling**: We created code that utilized interrupts to detect button presses, ensuring that the state machine appropriately responded to these inputs.
4. **State Machine Implementation**: We implemented the state machine functionality according to the documentation, which enabled the LEDs to display Morse code patterns.
5. **State Machine Documentation**: We created state machine documentation using draw.io, saved as a PDF, to describe the state machine's operation and meet technical specifications.
6. **Lab Questions**: We thoroughly discussed and answered the lab questions, providing evidence from our work.
7. **Coding Best Practices**: We followed coding best practices, including code formatting, commenting, and ensuring functional logic.

## State Machine Operation
The state machine we designed controls the LEDs to display Morse code patterns, conveying a message. When a button is pressed, the Morse code message changes. The state machine accurately follows the prescribed patterns and adjusts when necessary based on user input.

## State Machine Documentation
We created state machine documentation using draw.io and saved it as a PDF. This documentation comprehensively describes the state machine's operation, including states, transitions, and Morse code patterns. It aligns with the technical specifications and is available in the project folder.

## Lab Questions
We addressed all lab questions thoroughly, providing evidence from our code and explaining our reasoning.

## Coding Best Practices
Our code adheres to coding best practices, including consistent formatting, detailed comments explaining functionality, and logic that ensures the code's readability and maintainability.

Overall, this project allowed us to apply our knowledge of state machines, interrupts, and embedded systems programming while achieving the specified Morse code LED message functionality.
